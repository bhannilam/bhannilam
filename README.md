- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I am currently 3rd year PhD student in Regulatory Biology at Cleveland state university, with a primary research focus on inflammatory disease caused by mutations in P4-ATPase. My research aims to address critical gaps in understanding the mechanism behind inflammation caused by mutation in ATP8b1. My work aims to identify novel mechanism for inflammation in PFIC1, which can be a potential therapeutic target. During my PhD journey, I have been committed to advance my scientific knowledge through innovative research. I have successfully designed and executed experiments involving ELISA, High-resolution microscopy, Flow cytometry, Animal experiments, etc. Beyond my research, I am also active to science communication and mentoring. I am actively engaged in mentoring undergraduate researchers, participates in academic workshops with an effort to promote an inclusive and cooperative scientific community.
